            <p class="content">The coronavirus crisis and its economic effects
			coincides with the 50th anniversary of Milton Friedman's influential 
			assertion that the social responsibility of business was only to increase its profits, within the law. 
			This mantra has gained a strong hold on much of business practice, with a fierce focus on the short term. It is in this context that business 
			leaders will be responding to the effects of the coronavirus crisis.</p>
